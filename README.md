An ongoing research project. I'm trying to employ OpenDSS API to simulate faulty open conductor situations on a test feeder. And then, develope a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect these events using smart meter data.
Open conductor faults are dangerous and their detection is quite critical to the eletrical power industry.
